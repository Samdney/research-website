### I make research for you
Hi,

my name is Carolin and I'm an independent mathematical scientist. I work as freelancer on topics around it-security and online privacy & anonymity with mathematical (Cryptography, Algebra, Number Theory) focus.

I publish all my work under free licenses (as long it is not limited by third parties). I belive in open knowledge and that the results of research and its access has to be possible and free, without any fees, for everybody.

I would be happy to get your support, to protect our right for private communication and online security.

For more information about me, look at my CV on <a href="/about.html" title="About"><font color="#2196F3">About</font></a>  
and contact me with your project description by email!
