			Hi,<br />
			<br />
			my name is Carolin and I'm an independent mathematical scientist. I work as freelancer on topics around IT-security, decentralized networks, online privacy & anonymity and censorship circumvention with mathematical (Cryptography, Algebra, Number Theory) focus.

			<b>Human rights, the right to knowledge, education and the freedom of speech</b> are important values of the human society. They support new kinds of thinking which help to bring the mankind more forward in their place on our planet.<br />
			<br />
			But this rights are not so naturally in certain countries, like it should be. <b>Countries censor sources of information</b>, like the internet which has became the most important source for knowledge and freedom of speech.

	<b>I'm an independent mathematical scientist (Research Scientist).</b> I work on topics around IT-security, decentralized networks, online privacy & anonymity and censorship circumvention.<br />
	<br />
	I had the luck to be born in a country in which this rights are respected, with free education and open knowledge for everybody, with freedom of speech and without censorship.<br />
	<br />
	Thankful for the possibilities I had, to be able to go to school, attending university and get an high education, <b>I see a responsibility for using my skills and knowledge, to help people</b> who don't have this luck.<br />
	<br />
	So, I started to <b>work</b> on an independant base, <b>on anti-censorship and online privacy & anonymity</b> topics, to help people to get their right to knowledge and freedom of speech.
