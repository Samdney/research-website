Stuff for which I'm currently doing pre-research, writting work concepts, project- and funding proposals, organizing funding or already have funding but no time to work on and finally projects which have to be more private, for the moment, like my patent application.

<ul>
<li>
	Scary<br />
	<font style="font-size:14px;">
		Scary is the idea for a Pluggable Transport for Tor Bridges. It calls Scary, since the idea is scary :). It bases on some concepts of quantum mechanics.
	</font>
</li>
<!-- TODO
<li>
	Patent application 01: Free Pony<br />
	<font style="font-size:14px;">
		Already for a longer time, I have stuff for a patent application which I want to let it happen, now.<br />
		This is a private project until patent application will be finished. After this, I want to make it public for beeing used freely for non-commercial aims.
