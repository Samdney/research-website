research_areas_summaries:	Be a mouse. Be clever. Find what you are looking for.| If you do not give all your data to one company.| Decentralization rocks.| Sometimes, you have to look at things more mathematical.| Algebra and Number Theory are fascinating topics which play an important role in our daily life.| Examination of apps for privacy breaks.| Stuff which fits to nothing else.

Stuff which is already funded but there exists still not an exact date to work on it.

<p>
None.

Stuff for which I'm currently doing pre-research, writting work concepts, project- and funding proposals. 

<ul>
<li>
	Camera Encryption Hunter<br />
    <font style="font-size:14px;">
    	Years ago, I worked on a tool to analyze Canon camera firmware for adding automatically encryption possibilities to it.<br />
		In this project, I want to rework on this, since the old version didn't work fully and also try to extend it to cameras of other manufacturers.<br />
		Additional comment for legal reasons: My tool didn't change the original firmware. It worked as additional software saved on the SD Card and then also running from the SD Card.
    </font>
</li>
<li>
	Scary<br />
	<font style="font-size:14px;">
		Scary is the idea for a Pluggable Transport for Tor Bridges. It calls Scary, since the idea is scary :). It bases on some concepts of quantum mechanics.
	</font>
</li>
<li>
	Mathematical Models: Decentralized Networks <br />
	<font style="font-size:14px;">
		I have worked on a bunch of different topics about mathematical modelling, mathematical topology, mathematical computer science and graph theory aspects of (privacy protecting) decentralized networks.<br />
		I want to rework on this stuff and write some academic papers.<br />
		I assume that I will break down this in several part-projects for funding reasons and will then give you more detailed information about each part, soon.
	</font>
</li>
<li>
	Patent application 01: Free Pony<br />
	<font style="font-size:14px;">
		Already for a longer time, I have stuff for a patent application which I want to let it happen, now.<br />
		This is a private project until patent application will be finished. After this, I want to make it public for beeing used freely for non-commercial aims.

<h2 id="MyProjects">My projects</h2>
<font style="color: red;">The following stuff is from an older website version and (very) old work. I'm currently still work on the content of the projects site for an update. So this section is for clean up and also because of historical reasons.</font>

<p>
In the following, a list of my past, current and currently on-the-way for funding projects.<br />
List is incomplete.
