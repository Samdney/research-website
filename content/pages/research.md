research_areas_main_text:   Mathematical Computer Science uses the application of mathematics to problems in computer science and the development of mathematical methods suitable for the formulation of computer science theories and new design concepts.<br /> In contrast, Theoretical Computer Science is an intersection of general computer science and mathematics which focuses on mathematical topics within computer science like e.g. algorithms, computational complexity theory or automata theory.
